# Stock-Returns-Linear-and-PCA-Regression

This project was from my Linear Algebra class. We were asked to perform a normal linear regression and a PCA Regression by using Singular Value Decomposition(SVD), alongside a series of other tasks like visualizing fitted values over time versus actual results over time. The data used are included in the repository and are stock return data as well prices of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF.
